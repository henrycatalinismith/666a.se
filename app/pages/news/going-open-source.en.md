# Going Open Source

Today's the six month anniversary of the launch of 666a. On launch day, I wasn't sure if anyone would even use it. Six months and several thousand sent emails later, the demand's proven, and it's feeling like too long since I took a scary leap of faith like that. So just in time for May 1st tomorrow, here's another gamble: 666a is now an open source project!

The repo's over at [https://codeberg.org/henrycatalinismith/666a.se](https://codeberg.org/henrycatalinismith/666a.se). Go chuck it a star if you have a GitHub account!

If you're interested in taking a deeper look, there's info about [setting up a 666a development environment](/about/development), some devops things to help [avoid disasters and facilitate recovering](/about/operations) from them when they do happen, and even some [architectural notes](/about/architecture).

I've also begun documenting the work ahead as GitHub issues and projects. Some of it is marked as “good first issue” to facilitate getting a first commit for anyone who'd like to jump in right away. You'll notice I have big ideas for the labour law translations in particular. There's lots to do though, and I haven't been able to write it all down in time for today. The signup flow could probably use a bit of love, for example. I'd also really like to have as much of the site as possible available in English, Swedish and Arabic, and I don't have the time or linguistic ability to make that happen alone.

So whether you're a designer, or a developer, or maybe you speak a bunch of languages and can help with translating, or whatever else, don't be a stranger. I'm available at [henry@catalinismith.com](mailto:henry@catalinismith.com) in addition to the various tools and platforms listed above.

In the meantime, do us both a favour and share this somewhere!
