## Let's Talk!

If you're interested in getting more involved in making 666a happen, then that's fantastic! It's mainly a matter of taking the first step and reaching out to make contact, really.

### Email

Drop a quick email to [henry@666a.se](mailto:henry@666a.se) and say hi. I care a lot about 666a's mission and I automatically like anyone who's interested in this kind of stuff, so don't be shy.

### GitHub

Have a look at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/666ase/666a/issues). Maybe you'll spot something you'd like to fix! Or maybe create an issue of your own?
